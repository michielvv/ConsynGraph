ConsynGraph
==================

A JavaScript Graphing Library based on Raphael.

 * Data definition is seperated from display property definition. (This will ease additional data loading from a JSON source)
 * All types of graphs can be rendered together into a single view. So you can plot a line on top of a barchart, etc.
 * All parts of the rendering are individually replaceable.
 * It's possible to combine multiple graphs into a single grid, with aligned axes (or not)
